# ü§î What in the world is this?
Unbinilium 0.5 is a GDI Malware by me. It is inspired by Ununennium 0.5 by NotCCR.

‚ù§Ô∏è For skidders
I know that some people will skid some effects after I release Unbinilium 0.5.exe's source code to put in their malwares, and even if I complain about it, nothing will change...

So for that reason I added a GPLv3 license. In other words, if you use/modify a part of my code, you need to make your project open source and give me credit!
